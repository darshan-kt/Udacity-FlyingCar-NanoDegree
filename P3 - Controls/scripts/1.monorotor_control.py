Monorotor Review
we will design a controller for a monorotor that moves only in the vertical direction.
We want to focus on controls concepts, so we will be hiding or ignoring some of the details from the last lesson. Most importantly:

    1. Ignoring yaw - this will let us focus on ùëß motion.
    2. Ignoring propellers - we will set the thrust property directly instead of worrying about the rotational rates that generate that thrust.

    Open loop controller
    This code implements an "open loop controller" for a monorotor.

    Notice that the controller only needs to know the mass of the vehicle and the initial state (assumed to be ùëß= 0 and ùëßÀô=0).
    The thrust_control function is then called at each timestep. All that this function needs to know is where the drone should be (target_z) and when it needs to be there (dt)!

Simulating Open Loop Control

 Read through simulation code¬∂

Read through sections 1 and 2 of the code below.

In section 1, note how perceived_mass is calculated and used.

In section 2, note how the simulation actually works:

    1. The controller commands a thrust based on the target_z.
    2. This drone's thrust is set to this value.

# The mass that the controller believes is not necessarily the
# true mass of the drone. This reflects the real world more accurately.

 Modify MASS_ERROR

Play around with different values for this parameter. Try 1.0, 1.01, etc...
Note the effect this has on the resulting trajectory!
