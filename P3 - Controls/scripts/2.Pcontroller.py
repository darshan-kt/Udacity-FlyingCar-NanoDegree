TODO 2 - Explore p controller trajectories

Once you see "Tests pass", your PController should be working! The code below attempts to fly the vehicle up to ùëß=‚àí1
from its start position at ùëß=0 (this is also called a "step function" change in position).

Now, try playing around with the code below. Answer the following questions for yourself:

    What do "p controlled" trajectories generally look like (when trying to follow a step function change in position)?

    How do changes to K_P influence the resulting trajectory?

    How robust is this controller to changes in MASS_ERROR? Try changing the value to 1.5 and observing the result. Compare this to the open loop plot when this parameter was just 1.01.
