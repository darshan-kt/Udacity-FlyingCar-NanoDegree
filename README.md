# P1 - Backyard Flyer Project
In this project, set up a state machine using event-driven programming to autonomously flying a drone in square path. You will be using flying a quadcopter in Unity simulator.

# P2 - Motion Planning Project
In this project write & integrate the path planning algorithm to find least possible path between start and end poins in a urban environment map and finally feed waypoints to simulated drone to navigate towards target point.

# P3 - Quadrotor Control project
In this project written the 3D quadrotor controller algorithm with adding body rate control, roll pitch control, altitude controller, lateral position control, yaw controller block to generate the motor commands for given commanded thrust and moments with respect to the trajecotry points. Finally tune the PID values for each individual control blocks. 
The below video shows the accurately tunned controller to follow eight geometric trajectory.
